# Making a virtual environment (venv) for Python 3.7

# Create a folder that will store all your files related to comp physics

mkdir Comp_Phys

# Move into that folder

cd Comp_Phys

# When inside, create a new subdirectory that will house the virtual environment.
# Call this new folder 'venv'

python -m venv venv

# If you're using version control through git, create a file called '.gitignore' and add the name of the directory that has the virtual environment:

touch .gitignore
echo 'venv' > .gitignore

# Now the venv directory won't be uploaded to GitHub.

# Activate the virtual environment:

source venv/bin/activate

# Check to see which python is being called:

which python

# Use pip to install ipython and jupyter notebook

pip install ipykernel

# Create a new kernel for ipython

ipython kernel install --user --name=Comp_Phys
# (This will be installed with your global version of python, NOT in your virtual environment)

# Make sure that IPython is being called through the python in the virtual environment:

python -m IPython
