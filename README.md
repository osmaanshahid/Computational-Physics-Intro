# Computational Physics Intro
This contains code and directions to teach the basics of computational physics through Python.
The project is still in its very early stages and will go through topics in a traditional two-semester or one year physics course, like kinematics, work and energy, forces, oscillations, electromagnetism, thermodynamics, some quantum mechanics, and hopefully some higher level physics, if possible.

Though the primary audience is composed of late high school and early college students who are interested in the subject, this repository and its code are freely available to anyone who may find it useful.



# Setup Guide (very rough draft - needs lots of work)

1.) Download Python
    - Add instructions for installation on Windows, Mac, and Linux
    - Be sure to add python (the executable and the scripts) to your path variable
    
2.) Install Jupyter Notebook
    - Install the notebook by using the package Anaconda or Miniconda
    - Install using the command 'pip3 install jupyter'
    - https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html
    
3.) Create a new directory for this project    
    
    
4.) Create a virtual environment
    - https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
    - python -m venv .CompPhys
    - .CompPhys\Scripts\activate
